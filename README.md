# IndexSpaceVisualization
THREE.js experiment to create an domain flow index space visualization component

Starting from a blatent rip-off from three.js editor at https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js in the editor directory.

The goal is to create an interactive visualization of the geometric attributes of domain flow algorithms and their inherent parallel execution dynamics.
